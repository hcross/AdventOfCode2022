# Day 6 with V

This 6th day challenge will be with the [V language](https://vlang.io), suggested by my colleague [Anthony Pena](https://github.com/kuroidoruido).

To get this puzzle working, you'll need V to be installed.

On MacOS, you simply have to run `brew install vlang`.

Then to run the program, just run `v run .`.
