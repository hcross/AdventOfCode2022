# Day 8 with Python

This 6th day challenge will be with the [Python language](https://www.python.org/).

Don't judge me, this not a so much esoteric language to try, but my day was enought complicated üòÆ‚Äçüí®

To get this puzzle working, you'll need python 3 to be installed.

On MacOS, you simply have to run `brew install python`.

On Linux, try `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install python3-full` if you're on a Debian derivated distribution, for other distributions, I'm sure you can figure it out !

On Windows, you can count on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and get this command executed : `choco install python3`

Then to run the program, just run `make run`.
