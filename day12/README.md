# Day 12 with Nim !

For this twelfth day, I'll keep up with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) since the challenges are becoming more and more difficult and I can't pace into getting in a new language everyday.

To install nim on MacOS, just type the following command :

```sh
brew install nim
```

Then to run the program, run the following command :

```sh
nim compile --run day12.nim
```
