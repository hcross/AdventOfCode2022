# Day 11 with Nim !

For this eleventh day, I'll try [Nim](https://nim-lang.org). This language seems cool and without hassles (need to recover from assembly script and Pascal).

Hopefully, it supports big integers thanks to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/nim-lang/bigints).

To install nim on MacOS, just type the following command :

```sh
brew install nim
```

Then to run the program, run the following command :

```sh
nim compile --run day11.nim
```
