# Day 15 with V

This 15th day challenge will be with the [V language](https://vlang.io) again
since I want to deep further in the exploration of this language (and still have
too few energy to switch to a brand new language I don't know - coz I have the
flu).

To get this puzzle working, you'll need V to be installed.

On MacOS, you simply have to run `brew install vlang && v up`.

To run the unit tests, just run `v common_test.v`.

Then to run the program, just run `v run .`.
