# Advent of code 2022

This is first attempt to go through the *Advent of Code* event.

As I'm seeking for new challenges everytime, for my entries, I want to try to use a language or framework that I **DO NOT** use in a daily basis.

Thus you should expect a lot of languages anti-patterns, lack of common usages and maybe some lack of logic !

The goal here is to try to get the basics of each language tried.
