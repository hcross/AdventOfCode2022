# Day 13 with Nim !

For this thirteenth day, I'll keep up with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) again !

To install nim on MacOS, just type the following command :

```sh
brew install nim
```

You will also need to install `nim-stacks`:

```sh
nimble install stacks
```


Then to run the program, run the following command :

```sh
nim compile --run day13.nim
```
